## 3. Model Development and Training:

Detail the model architecture:

Type of model (CNN)
Layers used (convolutional, pooling, dense, etc.)
Activation functions
Optimizer, loss function, and metrics
Training process (epochs, batch size)
Use of callbacks (learning rate reduction)
## 4. Model Evaluation and Performance:

Present the results:

Model accuracy on the test set
Loss of Model
Analysis of training and validation curves
Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
Visualization of correct and incorrect predictions
## 5. Conclusion and Future Work:

 Summarize the key findings:

Overall performance of the model
Potential for real-world applications
