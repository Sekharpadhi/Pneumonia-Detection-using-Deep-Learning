# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
This project develops an AI-powered system for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. Using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), it distinguishes between normal and pneumonia-affected lungs, assisting medical professionals in faster and more accurate diagnosis, ultimately improving patient care.
